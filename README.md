# Performance  Tests

Repository contains framework utils, services and tests for perfomrning load and performance tests.

It's a monorepo and each layer is divided into inidvidual projects.

✨ *This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos](https://nx.dev)* ✨


## Nx : Code Generation

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add project
npx nx g @nx/js:lib tests

```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).
